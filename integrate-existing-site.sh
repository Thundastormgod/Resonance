## Integrating Docker Pipeline with Existing Repository

Your existing Netlify deployment from `https://github.com/Thundastormgod/Resonance` can be enhanced with the Docker pipeline.

### Steps to Integrate:

1. **Copy Pipeline Files to GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   # Copy these files to your GitHub repository:
   .github/workflows/deploy.yml    # CI/CD pipeline
   Dockerfile.frontend            # Frontend container
   Dockerfile.backend             # Backend container  
   netlify.dockerfile             # Netlify build
   docker-compose.yml             # Development setup
   deploy.sh                      # Deployment automation
   ```

2. **Update Netlify Build Settings**
   In your Netlify dashboard:
   - Build command: `./deploy.sh build && ./deploy.sh netlify`
   - Publish directory: `netlify-deploy`
   - Node version: `20`

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   Add these to Netlify dashboard:
   ```
   NODE_VERSION=20
   DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
   SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_SANITY_TOKEN=your_token
   ```

4. **GitHub Actions Setup**
   Add these secrets to GitHub repository:
   ```
   NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_netlify_token
   NETLIFY_SITE_ID=your_site_id
   ```

### Benefits After Integration:

âœ… **Automated Deployment**: Push to main branch triggers deployment
âœ… **Docker Consistency**: Same environment for dev/staging/production  
âœ… **Enhanced Development**: Local Docker environment with hot reload
âœ… **Container Registry**: Docker images pushed to GitHub Container Registry
âœ… **Zero Downtime**: Seamless integration with existing deployment

### Development Workflow:

```bash
# Local development (traditional)
npm run dev

# Local development (Docker)
npm run docker:dev

# Deploy to production
git push origin main  # Triggers automatic deployment
```

### Manual Deployment:

```bash
# Full pipeline
npm run pipeline:full

# Deploy to Netlify only  
npm run deploy:netlify
```
